==========

Websockets framework together with cowboy as described in my book
Programming Erlang (2'nd edition) (To be published in 2013).


INSTALLATION
============

This program uses rebar to fetch and install the necessary dependencies.
First you need to install rebar. If you don't have rebar then you can install
a pre-build binary from https://github.com/rebar/rebar/wiki/rebar.

To install:

Give the following command ONCE only:

<pre>
   $ rebar get-deps
</pre>

To run the demos

<pre>
   $ make
</pre>
